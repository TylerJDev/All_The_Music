# All The Music
**⚠️ Note - This project is not currently being maintained, but may be picked back up in the future!**

All The Music aggregates music data from multiple sources into a single useful website!

Look for your favorite artists, albums, and tracks! Get details for future venues and connect with others through social media!

***To-Do:***
  - Refactor parts of JS
  - Featured Images.

**Known Issues:**
  - Get albums from tracks where LAST.FM doesn't have any album data
  - Empty album cover on albums with `undefined` data using query:
    - `index.html?query=Blu+&+Madlib&type=artist`
    - `index.html?query=Blu+&+Exile&type=artist`

---

## Future Updates
  - Photos for artists & albums.
  - Background image featuring top artist(s)
  - Implement music-playable API (i.e. Spotify, Youtube, etc...)

## Acknowledgements (APIs)
  - Last.FM,
  - MusicBrainz,
  - SeatGeek,
  - YouTube
