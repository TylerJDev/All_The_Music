# All The Music

## What is this?
All The Music is a website that allows you to look up different artists, albums and tracks with data provided by Last.FM, MusicBrainz and more.

## TO DO
  - Refactor parts of JS
  - Last.FM doesn't vet their artist pictures, so ANYTHING could be the featured image, I need to find a workaround.

# Issues
  - Get albums from tracks where LAST.FM doesn't have any album data
  - Empty album cover on albums with undefined data @ index.html?query=Blu+&+Madlib&type=artist && index.html?query=Blu+&+Exile&type=artist

# Future Updates
  - Photo section for artists, albums.. Could integrate Instagram feed
  - Add background image of that artist for top artist(s)
  - Implement Spotify API, or API that allows music to be played I.E, YouTube..

## Acknowledgements
